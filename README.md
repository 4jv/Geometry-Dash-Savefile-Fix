# Geometry Dash Savefile Fix

This tool can fix most problems caused unable to open the game by the savefiles. (which is the game will only launch if you move the savefiles to other folders)

## Installation

You need to install at least [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this program.  
Or just download the [release](https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix/releases) for Windows (Windows XP not supported, sorry) so you don't need to install Python.  

## Not working?

If you encounter any problem (unable to fix / doesn't work after fixed), feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix/issues/new) or contact me on Discord (WEGFan#1440).
